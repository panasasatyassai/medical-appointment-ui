A fully client-side React application for booking appointments with doctors. Users can fill in their name, email, and preferred date/time, and their appointments are stored in the browser's `localStorage`. The application also includes routing and a separate page to view all booked appointments.

# Improvements With More Time
-Add backend (Firebase or Express) for real database storage

-Include doctor selection from available list

-Form validation and error display improvements

-Add cancel/delete option for appointments

-Responsive UI with better design using Tailwind or Bootstrap

# Challenges Faced
-Handling dynamic routes for doctor profiles

-Ensuring form validation and conditional rendering

-Managing localStorage updates and ensuring data is reactive
